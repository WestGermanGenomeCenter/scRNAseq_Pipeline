# WGGC Single Cell

## IMPORTANT!!!
The pipeline and this README.md is designed to work on the HPC of the HHU, Germany.
General instructions for simply running with snakemake exist, but are very short and not extensivley tested yet.

For instructions on how to run this scRNA-seq analysis pipeline based on Seurat and Snakemake see the .pdf in the documentation/ folder.

Since my student job at the WGGC is over I will most likely not be working on the pipeline anymore.
