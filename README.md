This pipeline is a Seurat based scRNA-seq analysis Snakemake pipeline.
What the pipeline does, how it works and instructions on how to use it can be found in the documentation/Documentation.pdf.

The pipeline is designed to work on the HPC of the HHU, Germany.
General instructions for simply running with snakemake exist, but are very short and not extensivley tested yet.
