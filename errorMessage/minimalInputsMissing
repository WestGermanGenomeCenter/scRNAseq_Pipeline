Some of the inputs that you can do at the very beginning are missing.
These inputs include:
- HHU_HPC
- maxRAM (if you don't know, just use the value in the config_example.yaml)
- mtPattern
- mullimodal
- multiSampled
- HTO
- numberOfCells
- otherMetaName (has to be a list meaning in [])

- for each sampleInputs one of these values:
    - name
    - expectedPercentDoublets
    - otherMetaData (in the same order as otherMetaName above)

If your dataset has only 1 sample or all samples have the same condition, you still have to enter something in otherMetaName and otherMetaData, e.g.:
otherMetaName [condition]
sampleInputs:
  - name: onlySample
    otherMetaData: [A]
  - name: in_case_all_samples_have_same_condition
    otherMetaData: [A]

For more information please take a look at the config_example.yaml or read the documentation.
